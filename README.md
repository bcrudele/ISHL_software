## Key Features

- Dynamic Entry: The algorithm requires four user entry variables. The number of skaters, number of teams, max skill deviation, and total results are requested from the user before the algorithm begins. This allows for highly modular results.
- skills.xlsx: Template Excel file provides easy entry of player data and analytics.
- Output File: Generates output file for export. 

## Usage

1. Step one fill out player data sheet. Do NOT adjust pre-calculated count values in Col. 5.
2. Step two run through MATLAB R2022 or better.
3. Step three follow terminal prompts.
4. Step four export Excel file saved with timestamp.
