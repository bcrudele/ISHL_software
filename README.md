## Key Features

- Dynamic Entry: The algorithm requires user entry to run according to your standards. A number of teams, max skill deviation, and total samples are requested from the user before the algorithm begins. This allows for highly modular results.
- skills.xlsx: Template Excel file provides easy entry of player data and analytics.
- Output File: Generates 'output.xlsx' file for export. 

## MATLAB Usage

1. Ensure skills.xlsx is in the same folder as the runtime folder.
2. Fill out skills.xslx data sheet. Do NOT adjust pre-calculated count values in Col. 5.
3. Run through MATLAB R2022 or better.
4. Follow terminal prompts.
5. Excel file is saved with a time-stamp in the corresponding folder.

## Python Usage

1. Ensure skills.xlsx is in the same folder as team_finder.exe
2. Fill out skills.xlsx data sheet. You can add/remove players and their corresponding skill. 
3. Terminal will appear, follow GUI input prompt for each input. This program can support up to 6 teams per sample.
4. Possible team combinations are saved to an Excel file in the same folder.
